This archive contains autoScale.py, a python tool for performing an automated 
finite-size scaling analysis as introduced in the appedix of the article

  Houdayer, J. and Hartmann, A. K.
  "Low-temperature behavior of two-dimensional Gaussian Ising spin glasses",
  Phys. Rev. B 70, 014418 (2004).
 
The archive further includes an exemplary scaling analysis for the 
problem of 2d site percolation.

System requirements:
====================
In order to use autoScale.py, the following requirements have to be fulfilled:

Type 'tar -xzvf SCALING_ANALYSIS.tar.gz' to unpack the archive.
For further information about program options and file-formats look
up autoScale.py or see the users guide autoScale_guide.pdf

autoScale.py has been under development since 2007. It was implemented 
under Python 2.3.4 (and later versions) and it imports only basic Python
modules that come with any python installation. 
Accordingly, check that you have installed Python 2.3 or a later version 
on your system. You can check your current Python version by typing
'python -V'. If necessary, see http://www.python.org/ or ask your system 
administrator.
